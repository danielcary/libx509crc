This Python file can be used to automatically download the known list of CT logs from Google, and then convert it to the .cnf format that OpenSSL requires. It is derived from https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency/tree/master/python
No external python libraries are required.

Two files will be generated, log_list.json and log_list.cnf
